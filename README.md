- Hi, I’m Jeff Bellucci, it's nice to meet you.
- In my career as an engineer, I've most frequently worked with Ruby, Rails, and various Javascript front ends (Jquery, Backbone.js, React.js, and Turbo/Stimulus.js)
- I worked on Rails APIs, multiple Rails SAAS platforms, browser extensions, as well as some mobile development.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the code I have written is in private repositories and/or is under NDA
- I’m presently working on a personal project, that I intend to port for iOS/Androind.  It's a Rails 7 application for Bay area commuters.  It is also helping me to stay sharp and improve my skills with the new front-end framework that now ships with Rails 7 called Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus.js).  The application is still in active development when I have spare time, but you can still check out my progress at www.bart-live.com.
<br>I tend to deploy features in big chunks, and I will try to post updates here.  Currently, the main map feature/live departure times in both a minutes from now, and clock time format are available.  Next will be a Navbar and user sign up/authentication.  I have some fun ideas for what users will have access to once logged in, but I don't want to spoil any surprises.
- I open to new senior full-stack or backend Rails opportunites.
