- Hi, I’m Jeff Bellucci, it's a pleasre to meet you.
- In my career as an engineer, I've primarily worked as a full-stack engineer mostly with Ruby on Rails, as well as a variety of Javascript front-ends (for example: plain Javascript, Jquery, Backbone.js, React.js, and Turbo/Stimulus.js, etc.).  Back-end frameworks appear to have more staying power than front-ends.  Over the course of my nearly 10 year long career in web develoment, I have seen the popularity of various front-end patterns wax and wane, so I do my best to focus on making sure I maintain solid Javascript fundamentals, since you never know when the industry will decide a front-pattern is obscelescent.
- I have worked on a number Rails SAAS platforms (including those requring Hippa compliane), Rails APIs, browser extensions, as well as some mobile development. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the code I have written in my professional career is in private repositories and/or under NDA, so much of what you will find here are old toy projects, except for my pinned repo, which is my current project.
- IF you would like to see something I am actively defeloping please check out my [Bart-Live-2 repo](https://github.com/jeffmbellucci/bart-live-2), where I’m presently working on an app idea that I intend to eventually release for the web, Apple and Android store.  
- Please keep me in mind for staff or senior/lead full-stack or backend Rails opportunities.
