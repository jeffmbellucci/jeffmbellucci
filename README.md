- Hi, I’m Jeff Bellucci, it's nice to meet you.
- In my career as an engineer, I've most frequently worked with Ruby, Rails, and various Javascript front ends (Jquery, Backbone.js, React.js, and Turbo/Stimulus.js)
- I worked on Rails APIs, multiple Rails SAAS platforms, browser extensions, as well as some mobile development.
- I’m presently working on a Rails 7 application and improving my skills with the new front-end framework that now ships with Rails 7 called Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus.js).
- I am currently looking for senior full-stack or backend Rails positions.
- You can reach me at jeffmbellucci@gmail.com.
