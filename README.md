- Hi, Iâ€™m Jeff Bellucci, it's nice to meet you.
- In my career as an engineer, I've most frequently worked with Ruby, Rails, and various Javascript front ends (Jquery, Backbone.js, React.js, and Turbo/Stimulus.js)
- I have worked on multiple Rails SAAS platforms, Rails APIs, browser extensions, as well as some mobile development.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of the code I have written is in private repositories and/or under NDA, so much of what you will find here are old toy projects, except for my pinned the pinned repo, which is my current project.
- Iâ€™m presently working on an app idea that I intend to port for the Apple and Android store.  It's a Rails 7 application for Bay area Bart commuters.  It is also keeping my code sharp and improving my skills with the new front-end framework that now ships with Rails 7, called Hotwire (Turbo/Stimulus.js). I've been pleasantly surprised by how easy the libraries are to learn and use, as well as how powerful and performant they are.  I think Turbo/Stimulus may even have the potential to augment React, but we'll have to wait and see, since it's so new by comparison.
- The application is in active development when I have spare time. You can check out my progress at https://bart-live.herokuapp.com. It is currently on a free Heroku hobby dyno until it gains some tranction.  If/when it does, I will upgrade the hosting and add background workers for some of the more advanced features I have already created the backend logic for, like text/email reminders containing departures for the date, time and station of your choice.
- I tend to deploy features in big chunks, and I will try to post updates here.  Currently, the main map/live departure time feature in both minutes from now and clock time formats are available.  Next will be a Navbar, closest station finder, and user sign up/authentication.  I have some fun ideas for what users will have access to once logged in, but I don't want to spoil any of the surprises. ðŸŽ‰
- Please keep me in mind for any senior full-stack or backend Rails opportunities.
